Weather iCal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wwqrd/weather_ical.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wwqrd/weather_ical) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wwqrd/weather_ical/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wwqrd/weather_ical)
============

This app turns particular weather conditions into an ics feed of events.

Currently it'll only tell you when it's going to rain, but the plan
is to allow the setup of custom weather conditions, e.g. `high_wind or
precipitation`.
